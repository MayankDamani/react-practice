Regular Component

=> A regular Component does not implement the shouldComponentUpdate(). It always returns true by
   default.


Pure Component

=> A pure Component implements shouldComponentUpdate() with a shallow props and state comparison.

SC of prevState with currentState
SC of prevProps with currentProps

if difference then Re-Render Component else component is not re-rendered - performance boost.

=> It is a good idea to ensure that all children components are also pure to avoid unexpected 
   behaviour.

=> Never mutate state. Always return a new object that reflect new state. 

=> Works only with Class component.
