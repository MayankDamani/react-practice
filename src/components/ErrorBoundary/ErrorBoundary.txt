What is Error Boundary?

=> A class component that implements either one or both of the lifecycle methods getDerivedStateFromError
or componentDidCatch becomes an error Boundary.

=> The static method getDerivedStateFromError is used to render a fallback UI after an error is thrown
and the componentDidCatch method is used to log the error information.
